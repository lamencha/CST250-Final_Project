# You can implement any sorting algorithm you choose.  You can really go two ways with this: implement the simplest algorithm you can think of in as few lines as possible or take on a faster, but more complex algorithm like heapsort.
# Input arguments:
#	$a0 - starting memory address of the array to be sorted
#	$a1 - number of elements in array
# A comparison of a number of sorting algorithms you might attempt can be found here:
